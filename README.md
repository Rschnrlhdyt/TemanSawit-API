## TemanSawit-API

<!-- Test -->

TemanSawit-API is a RESTful API that provides various functions to manage and process data related to oil palm plantations. This API is deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In making the RESTful APIs we use [NodeJS](https//nodejs.org/en/) with some other dependencies which are [Sequelize](https//sequelize.org), [ExpressJS](https//expressjs.com), JSON Web Token [JWT](https://jwt.io/), and [CORS](https//enable-cors.org/index.html).

The API consists of four main endpoints that provide different functions:

1. Authentication/Authorization API
2. Income API
3. Outcome API
4. [Ripeness Model API](https://github.com/TemanSawit/TemanSawit-ml-api)

Overall, TemanSawit-API provides a comprehensive and efficient solution for managing and processing data related to oil palm plantations.
